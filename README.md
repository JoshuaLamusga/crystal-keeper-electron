## Overview

Crystal Keeper is a tool for cataloging and organizing data, with a special focus on specimens.

### Getting Started

- Start by creating a collection to store individual entries for e.g. minerals. Entries in each collection store and display data based on the collection's template -- pick one, or make your own.

- It's easy to manage entries in your collections by grouping them. You can set up rules to automatically group entries, too.

- When you get everything looking good, you can print your entries.

> Crystal Keeper supports a lot of mineral-specific details, like auto-suggestions for official and common mineral names, chemical formulas, type localities and group classifications. These suggestions are compiled by carefully splicing mindat.org and rruff.org data.
